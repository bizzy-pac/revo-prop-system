# propsystem
Simple, useful, DarkRP building and prop minge protection.

**Description:**

This will "fade" (make them translucent and nocollided) when you pick up props to stop mingieness and assist with building. The effect will automatically go away when it's frozen. It also sets the velocity to 0 when it is let go of to disable throwing props, and there is an option to completely disable prop damage. It comes with a fully featured config.

**Installation:**

Simply download the zip or clone this repository into your addons folder.

**To do:**

* Make it so people can't get stuck - Don't unfade if there is a player inside of it.
