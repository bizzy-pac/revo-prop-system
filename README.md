# Revo Prop System

**Description:**

This will "fade" (make them translucent and nocollided) when you pick up props to stop minginess and assist with building. The effect will automatically go away when it's frozen. It also sets the velocity to 0 when it is let go of to disable throwing props, and there is an option to completely disable prop damage. It comes with a fully featured config.

Requests and issues are appreciated!
